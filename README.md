# INTEGRA-7_Xamarin_Android
INTEGRA_7_Xamarin for Android.

I have unfortunately been forced to split the INTEGRA_7_Xamarin project, and this is the one for Android only. The MIDI driver uses USB direct and is not depending on Android version with MIDI capabilities, but should work from 5.0 and up if memory is enough. I have been developing on Android 5.1 with 4 Gb of memory.

Windows UWP and MacOS versions are still available for reference and for faster testing of updates in the INTEGRA_7_Xamarin (the main) project.
