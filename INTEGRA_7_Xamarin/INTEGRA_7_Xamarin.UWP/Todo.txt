* Group, category and tone pickers are not set in accordance with the INTEGRA-7 at startup.
	* Done, but it seems like it does a lot of unneccesary work. Take a look at it!

* Changing tone from a drum kit to another type does not erase text on keyboard.

* Drum keys names are one key too low.

Some drum names are wrong.

* When a drum kit is selected on I7 before startup, app fails to fill in key names.

Changin tone does not set current tone for the editor. Editor always get the tone that was set in I7 at app start?!?

Category is set wrong in Edit. Fixed by changing it after wrong value has been found by this:
    cbEditTone_InstrumentCategorySelector.SelectedIndex = toneCategories.snsToneCategoryNameIndex[superNATURALSynthTone.superNATURALSynthToneCommon.Category];
	Check this list!

Some edit controls are too high.

* There is no black space between controls. Compare with I7 random app to see how to fix it.

* Edit SN-D crashes in UpdateSuperNaturalDrumKitKeySelector().

* Fix the store images.

// Implement a close function in all device-dependent project, empty for tablets but closes apps for desktops.
	// Use when vender driver is detected. No!

Edit hangs when sending a change via 5-pin MIDI.

* If studio set editor button is hit with no tone selected, it chrashes!

* Do not show librarian window unless MIDI is ok.

Continue on the Studio set editor.
	There are a lot of control labels that has no initial value.
	Column 1:
		* Tempo is not integer, is there a reason for that?
		* When selecting a studio set, selector is left blank, and when opening it, it is scrolled down halfways.
		* External part level reacts on arrow keys after 4 key presses. Is it not an integer?
		* Ext part chorus/reverb levels are not integers. When changing, they update tempo label, not their own labels!
	Column 2:
		System common settings:
			* Master key shift is not integer, is there a reason for that?
			* Cannot test 'Use scale tune switch' since I cannot find it in the manual, but it sends to I-7 so it is probably ok.
				(Not needed, there is an 'Equal' selection.)
			* There is a system tempo here, reason for that? Yes, this is the system tempo. The one in first column is the 
				* studio set tempo. And here below is a selector to let system control tempo, or studio set.
				* But it has no values in its label...
		Voice reserv:
		Chorus:
			Chorus-chorus:
				* Output select does not work.
				* Filter cutoff frequency is not properly set, but it works to change. Seems to be a bug in I-7. It reports wrong,
					* but if changed on the front panel, and from program change to delay and back agin, I-7 reports correct value.
				Rate/Hz controls (selectable with 'Rate (num/notesw)') occupies each one row, they should occupy the same row.
					(Wait with this one until we know if the overlaying works on all platforms, even if it seems ok for now.)
				* Hz low limits should be 0.05 to 10.
				* Hz in not properly initialized and still has the slider int problem.
				* Note in not properly initialized.
				* All sliders uses many arrow keypress to change one step. Not an integer?
				* Feedback is not properly initiated.
				* When selecting chorus-chorus, then selecting another page (reverb, motional surround etc.) and back again,
					* chorus page is set correctly to chorus-chorus, but shows only off parameters, not chorus-chorus parameters.
			Chorus-delay:
				* Output select does not work.
				* When selecting this from chorus-shorus, screen is not properly cleared.
				Num/note same problem as in chorus-chorus.
				* Num/note switches does not send to I-7.
				* Sliders int problem.
				* Center feedback is not initialized.
				* HF Damp lacks 'BYPASS' entry and possibly not initialized (maybe due to the missing entry).
		Reverb:
			* There are two time sliders in the same row and other GUI errors when first selected, but gets
				* right when selecting a type.
			* Does not react to type off.
			* Level is not initiated, and label has no space between text and value.
			* Most sliders (all but Spread) has the int problem.
				* GM2 reverb Time label shows no decimals.
		Motional surround:
			* Motional switch surround is missing.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		MasterEQ:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
	Column 3:
		* Maybe swap settings page selector with part selector. No!
		* Part is always set to part 2 after initialization, why?
		* Page selector is not set.
		Part settings page 1:
			* Change channel warning dialog lacks some text. Probably wrong type of dialog (there are two types).
			* Selecting tone via search box does not update I-7.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Part settings page 2:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Keyboard parameters:
			* Velocity range upper/lower should have 1 as minimum, not 0.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Scale tune parameters:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Key sliders has wrong upper/lower limits. Should be -64 -- +63.
		Midi:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Velocity curve type (adr 0x43) missing? Why is there a 'Phase lock' switch?
		Motional surround:
			* L/R and F/B lacks offsets. Should be in range -64 -- +63.
			* Ambience send level is not initialized.
		Studio set part EQ:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Switch is missing.

* Test these now that they exist:
* There is no return button in studio set editor!
* Save/SaveFile/LoadFile buttons missing
	Save and SaveFile are ok. LoadFile not yet fully implemented (see 6 lines below)
* Save slot selector is missing
* Save slot name input field s missing

* Delete studio set leaves in a state that causes to try to read a tone without any address (via Timer_Tick).
	Actually, it tried to read the altered set before I-7 was finished. Since I-7 allows this, we get invalid
	data, and the program crashes. Only way to get around this is with a await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(8));
	It actually takes 4 seconds, but just to make sure, we wait twice as long.

* Continue on the Favorites.

* Add Surround page. Invent new way of 'dragging' controls since image has no coordinates in events.

Add saving/loading settings in xml files (for all platforms!)
	Most done for UWP, except motional surround (if we need it).

* Why is not cbStudioSetPartKeyboardMute added to the GUI?

* Studio set part selector returns to part 1 when other is selected!

* When selecting studio set editor after startup, and then return to librarian, 
	motional surround is not fully read in. It is read in only when:
	1) Motional surround is selected before studio set editor after startup.
	2) Studio set editor is selected after startup and part subpage motional
		surround is selected. If so, motional surround will place labels
		correctly, if not they will all be centered due to this issue.

* Maybe add a switch for turning motional surround on/off?

* Debug session is sometimes not closed after closing main window!
	This was 'always' until I added a way to avoid initializing MIDI more than
	once, and get more than one input and/or one output device. Those were
	not terminated, and the app never stopped running. This also caused
	Suspend/resume and Suspend/terminate to fail.

* Verification tool reports crashes! (Maybe that has same cause as the issue above?)

* Librarian no longer changes sound on I-7!

* When selecting a _part_ with a drum set, keybord labels are not updated, unless a note is played first.
	* Also, when selecting part 10, part 1 is set to the drum set in part 10?!?

* Start -> Select studio set in Librarian -> never restores studio set and does nothing more.
* Start -> Select studio set in Librarian -> (fix above first!) Edit Tone -> Flickers and goes back to Librarian.
* Start -> Select studio set in Librarian -> (fix above first!) Edit Studio Set -> App terminates.
* Start -> Select studio set in Librarian -> (fix above first!) Motional surround -> All labels at center.
* Start -> Select studio set in Librarian -> (fix above first!) Motional surround -> Edit -> Out of memory exception.
* Start -> Edit Studio Set -> PleaseWait_StackLayout is not hidden when all is done, otherwise, ok.
* Start -> Edit Studio Set -> Librarian -> Studio set is reset to 1.
* Start -> Edit Studio Set -> Librarian -> Motional Surround -> All positioned at center.
* Start -> Edit Studio Set -> Librarian -> Select studio set -> Ok
* Start -> Edit Studio Set -> Librarian -> Edit -> Nothing happens!
* Start -> Motional surround -> Ok.
* Start -> Motional surround -> Librarian -> Edit Studio Set -> Ok, same as direct, see above.
* Start -> Motional surround -> Librarian -> Select Studio set -> Stops after reading Studio set names, before setting back studio set.
* Start -> Motional surround -> Librarian -> Modional Surround -> Ok.
* Start -> Edit -> Ok.
* Start -> Favorites -> Ok.
* Start -> Add favorite -> Star does not disappear when adding favorite via double-click. Works via button, however.
* Start -> Delete favorite folder -> Ok.
* Start -> Delete favorite -> Folders without favorite to delete has stars.
* Deleted favorite is still marked as favorite upon return to Librarian.

* Remove stopEditTimer.

* Studio set editor return button must not be enabled before everything is read in!

* Same thing with librarian.

* Try to remove the space between that sometime occurs images in Motional surround.
	They are now overlapping, which means that this must be tested on all platforms!

* Changing studio set from librarian does not update what is seen in motional surround and edit studio set.
	Always read studio set (but not names if already read) when entering motional surround.
	Always read studio set (but not names if already read) when entering edit studio set.

Finish color settings, some colors does not work on MacOS.

* Add settings:
	* Swap surround button with edit buttons and make a setting button to the right of the surround button.
	* Settings:
		* Put combined MSB and LSB in clipboard.
		* Selection of color schemes.

Changing sub-pages in tone edit creates all controls everytime. Why not keep them in memory?

* Motional Surround switch is not initially set as in I-7.

* Remove padding from buttons.

* Edit uses text input as labels, can that be replaced with labels?

Help column in Edit uses too much vertical space with two images,
	Example, edit a SN-S tone and select Unison Size. 
	Maybe it is just that one that is wrong in help declaration?

* Replace settings image with a button. (Because image colors cannot be customized.)

* Recognize piano keys in Settings to set correct colors.

* Save color preferences.

* Add Motional surround labels in Settings page.

Change logo images to higher resolution.

* Colorsettings does not work if more than one View is added to the same GridRow!

* I will now pause colorsettings and temporarily remove the settings button since
	this seems to be rather complex and holds the project that is almost
	ready for beta test and test on other platforms.

* Thought I had fixed the color problem, but no. Anyway, reintroduced color
	settings but do not use them for the editors.

* Restore custom edit colors restores some old colors.

* Librarian -> Studio set editor -> Librarian -> settings -> librarian -> studio set editor
	Stops with a white screen.

Fix margins.

* Adjust default margin colors to be closer to background colors.

* Remove default user scheme.

* Change 'Piano key cover color' to 'progress bar color'

Se if progress bar can be better.

* key presses uses type button. Needs to use pianokey type!
